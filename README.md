# Twitter
This twitter clone was built with the goal to be as close as possible to the original Twitter website. The website includes some of the main functions of twitter including, Tweets, User Profiles, Following Users, Display settings, and an Edit Profile Modal. The display settings modal and edit profile modal are also implemented as modals as links. Authentication is implemented using Supabase Auth and Supabase's PostgreSQL database is used to store data and handle queries using mainly PostgreSQL Functions.
